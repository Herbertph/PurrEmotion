## Overview
In this innovative and engaging game, players enter a world where empathy and understanding take center stage, as they assume the role of a clever and caring cat. The main quest of the game revolves around the cat's mission to assist its owner, who is facing significant life challenges. The game's environment is a beautifully rendered representation of the owner's home. Players interact with various elements within this space, each designed to offer clues and tools to aid in the quest. The owner, even without realizing it, will be a guide on this journey.

## The Quest
The primary obstacles in this game are the nuanced emotional states of the owner. The player must interpret subtle cues within the diary texts and the environment to understand what kind of support the owner needs. Time is also a factor; the player has limited time to respond to cues before the opportunity passes.

## Rewards
Rewards are not traditional points or power-ups but rather emotional milestones. Successfully interacting with the environment in ways that support the owner can lead to visible changes in the home's ambiance and the owner's demeanor, reflecting their improving mental state.

## Main Character
The main character is a clever and empathetic cat, serving as the player's avatar in the game. This cat is distinguished by its ability to sense and respond to the emotional needs of its owner.

## Environment
The game environment will take place in a person's bedroom... common elements of a bedroom will be present such as a wardrobe, bed, piles of clothes, computer desk, pictures, window, etc. The game is set in modern times and therefore will be easily recognizable by players.

## Menu

## Summary
Unlike most games, PurrEmotion is not about killing, stealing, and destroying, but rather about conveying a message.

This game is an invitation to step into the paws of a hero of a different kind - one whose superpower is empathy. Get ready to be touched, inspired, and deeply moved.
